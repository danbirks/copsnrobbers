#### Last Updated: 7/2/2014

#### Notes: 
This model is an updated version of the cops n robbers model presented in:

*Birks, D.J., Donkin, S. & Wellsmith, M. (2008). Synthesis over Analysis: Towards an Ontology for Volume Crime Simulation. 
In Liu, L., Eck, J. (eds.) Artificial Crime Analysis Systems: Using Computer Simulations and Geographical Systems. Hershey, PA: IGI Global.*  

It has been altered to run in Netlogo v5 (deprecating old functions etc) - it has not been thoroughly tested.
